# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Performing Analysis on Kickstarter Data to Uncover Trends

### Purpose of Analysis of Kickstarter Campaign Data

The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise understand if similar plays with similar campaign goals were successful, failed, or were canceled. We can help determine this by reviewing specific campaign goal amounts and also when certain launch dates were throughout the year. By taking into account funding goal amounts, the percentage rate of those successful or failed within a given funding range, and also how launch dates affect performance, we can help Louise make the best decision when setting a funding goal for her campaign.
